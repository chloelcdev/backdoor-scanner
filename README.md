# backdoor-scanner
Text and regex scanner that helps developers search files for backdoors. Can also be used anytime you need to search regex (currently broken) or text in files inside recursive folders

No clue if this still works, this was for Garrysmod way back in the day. Most backdoor code was pretty similar and relied on a few common exploits. This allowed people to easily scan their addons for malicious code.

Should still work as a generic regex tool.
